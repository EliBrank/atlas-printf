.TH _printf 3 "March 4, 2024" "1.0" "Atlas-Printf"
.SH NAME
_printf \- custom printf function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.br
.B int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B _printf
function produces output according to a format and supports the following:
.IP \fBc\fP
Character specifier- the 'int argument' is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is printed.
.IP \fBs\fP
String specifier- the 'const char *' argument is expected to be a pointer to an array/pointer to a string. Characters from the array are written up to and excluding the null byte ('\0').  
.IP \fB%\fP
Percent specifier- a '%' is printed.
.IP \fBd\fP
Integer specifiers- the int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
              The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits
              that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer
              digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.  The default
              precision is 1.  When 0 is printed with an explicit
              precision 0, the output is empty.
.IP \fBi\fP
Unsigned integer specifers.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
